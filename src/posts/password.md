In the beginning, please think about how you usually manage your own passwords. For me, the ways to
manage passwords are

1. Save in webpage
2. Write on notepad
3. Keep in mind

I like to save my password in chrome because many of my accounts are associated with my google
mailbox.

But after I did some research, I found that this method is not the safest way to store passwords.
And many security experts are using something called a password manager, which can not only put your
passwords in the safe but also enter the password on many devices.

Here are some password managers I recommend.

#### Dashlane
1. Syncs across all your Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS devices.
2. Offers all essential and advanced password management features.
3. Includes VPN protection.
4. Scans Dark Web for compromised accounts.


#### Lastpass
1. Password strength report and dark web monitoring tools.
2. Capable free version.
3. Secure sharing and password inheritance.
4. Two-factor authentication.
