### What are SSL and TSL?

SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer and, in short, it's the standard technology for keeping an internet connection secure and safeguarding any sensitive data that is being sent between two systems, preventing criminals from reading and modifying any information transferred, including potential personal details. TLS (Transport Layer Security) is just an updated, more secure, version of SSL.

### About security

Why would we want to have a secure website? Every website owner should take responsibility for ensuring the safety of its visitors, but unfortunately, some websites just aren’t secure. An unsafe website can spread malware, steal your information, send spam, and more. To protect yourself and your personal information, it’s important to know that a website takes your safety seriously.  Here are several signs that can tell you if your website is safe. You can look for the “S” in HTTPS, that’s because many URLs begin with “HTTPS” instead of just “HTTP” to indicate that they are encrypted. So the prefixes HTTP or HTTPS matter when we're talking about secure web sites. Also, you can check for a website privacy policy, find the site’s contact information or verify their trust seal. But you also need to know the signs of website malware like defacements, suspicious pop-ups, malvertising, malvertising and SEO spam. Because even if a website has an SSL certificate, a privacy policy, contact information, and a trust badge, it may still not be safe if it is infected with malware.

### SSL certificate authority

An SSL certificate is a bit of code on your web server that provides security for online communications. When a web browser contacts your secured website, the SSL certificate enables an encrypted connection. It’s kind of like sealing a letter in an envelope before sending it through the mail.

### Encryption

Encryption is the process that scrambles readable text so it can only be read by the person who has the secret code, or decryption key. It helps provide data security for sensitive information. So why would you care about this, one thing you have to know is that Internet privacy concerns are real because hacking is a big business. Encryption helps protect your online privacy by turning personal information into “for your eyes only” messages intended only for the parties that need them — and no one else. And it also helps businesses stay compliant with regulatory requirements and standards.
