title: Have Fun With Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple tic tac toe game I built. Generally speaking, this kind of project that requires a lot of javascript needs to be broken down into small parts to think about.

 
In the beginning, I would imagine myself as a player, I would like to be able to click on each cell, and the content in each cell will be the conversion between "X" and "O" according to which player's turn. Itâ€™s better to have a message that reminds me of whose turn it is. After the game is over, I would like to have a button to reset the game.
