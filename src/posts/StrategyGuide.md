Ollie is a skateboarding trick that allows the skater to jump over obstacles. This is the basis of
all skateboarding tricks. Learning how to make an ollie generally requires you to learn in two
aspects. The first is to learn the foot position, and the second is to learn the correct movements.
When these are all done, all you need to do is to perfect your ollie. Before practicing ollie, make
sure you already know how to stand on a skateboard and push your skateboard.

### The foot position and the correct movements

First of all, you have to know there are two kinds of stances, one is regular and another one is
goofy. The difference between these two stances depends on which foot is forwarding when you're
riding your skateboard. Now you can follow the following list to make your movements.

1.  Stand on your skateboard. Put your front foot behind the front bolts and place your back foot on
    the edge of the tail. Put your body weight in the middle of the skateboard. Here are two
    pictures that can demonstrate more about this.

2. When you are ready to jump, use your back feet to quickly point your tail to the ground. At the
   same time, your front foot should be lifted along with the skateboard, using the friction between
   the skateboard and the shoe to lift the skateboard.

3.  Now all you need to do is practicing ，just repeat the second step continuously because this is
    the most important part to make an ollie.

### Perfect your ollie

Now we are going to make a complete move.

1.  Stand on the skateboard, bend your knees, keep your center of gravity stable, and get ready to
    jump.
2.  Tap the tail quickly with your back foot. After you hear a clear sound after the tail hits the
    ground, let your body jump. And use the front foot to drive the skateboard up.
3.  When you feel that your front foot can no longer move upwards, your back foot will move closer
    to your body along with the board and use your front legs to drive the skateboard to move in the
    direction of sliding, making the board parallel to the ground.
4.  When you have done the above steps, you are ready to land. You must always keep the board
    parallel to the ground when landing. Place your feet on the bolts when landing, and bend your
    knees to cushion the impact on your knees.
