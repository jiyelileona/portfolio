## 你好(Hello)

I am Jiye Li (Leona), a front end developer. I'm a Chinese girl who's living in Canada now.
 
I love skateboarding. I've been playing with skateboards for about five years. This picture is of when I went to Beijing with my friends to take part in the Skateboard Day celebration organized by IASC(International Association of Skateboard Companies).

I also enjoy cooking. (Thanks for home quarantine! I can cook for myself everyday!) 

**O ever youthful, O ever weeping**
